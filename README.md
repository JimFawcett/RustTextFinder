https://JimFawcett.github.io/RustTextFinder.html

Tool to find text in files that match a regular expression.  Tested on Windows 10 and Ubuntu 20.04
- Contents of this repository will be replaced with the TextFinder being built as part of the <a href="https://github.com/JimFawcett/BuildOn">BuildOn Sessions</a>.
- You can find a complete implementation in the link above.
- That will be extended with RegEx search and parallel file processing soon.
- When that is done, these contents will be replaced with the new implementation.
